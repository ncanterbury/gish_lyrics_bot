Give me all you've got
And bring it on

Twenty thousand years ago
I'd probably feel this strong
Somewhere in a cave
Fighting the ice age

Showing off the tiger that I fought today
And the bite marks on my face

What a pretty sight
What a magic rhyme
I was gonna write but instead I read all of VICE

So maybe I'm brainless, maybe I'm wise
Maybe I'll just rip off wicked this time

Give her all you've got
And bring it on
Ninety thousand years ago
She'd probably feel this strong

Somewhere by the sea
Striking up dead trees
Suddenly the fire's burning down the beach

What a pretty sight
What a pretty line

Cut below the stoner smoke
The window from outside
Still shows a party
But it looks empty
Though she's got a white row keeping company

Give him all you've got
And bring it on

Ninety million years ago
He'd probably feel this strong
Somewhere on all fours
Proto- mammal and his thoughts are short,
Eaten by the remnants of the dinosaurs

Living in a shithole
Just to sell in his spare time
His suburban dad is kinda mad
But this is the most fun that he's ever had

Every day we're taking pills
afternoon and evening quil
Putting on a show like vaudeville

Every day we're taking pills

Putting on a show like vaudeville
