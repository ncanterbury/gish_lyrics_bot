Got to work on my brain then
Crawling back to my grave and
I'm certain that I'm gonna die this time
No doubt is left inside my mind tonight

So I'm just gonna wait for nausea to set in
I’m peacing out at eleven
The friendly girls are trying to comfort me
As if I’m a depressed chick at a frat party

Two faced bitches never lie
And therefore I never lie

Diagram this sin triangle for me tonight
Because I don't know what to say

A sickness by another name
Wouldn't be sweet either but
With luck, it would at least look much more tame

Let's see how personality works
Bill Woodruff here has something on his mind
He wants something
In fact--

I’ve got to work on my face now
I’m wearing shades when it's dark out
But don’t you worry I'm just being cool
Like everybody else around this school

And maybe I wanna see him
But then again I'm an isolationist
And on an accident, I'm like Japan
Before they went and traded stuff to other lands

And two faced bitches never lie
Therefore I never lie

Diagram this sin triangle:
But the biblical kind and not sine

I don't know what to say
A sickness by another name
Wouldn't be sweet either but
With luck, it would at least, like, not suck

What do we mean when we talk about personality?
What is your personality?

It's the way you get along with other people around you
And your changing environment
You want certain things

The way you go about getting those things reveals your personality
For example, did you ever want to go one place but yet wanted to go somewhere else?
What did you do?
How set was your personality?

Did you ever want, so much, to make a good impression on someone?
What did you do?
Did you ever feel alone? Out of place, when you very much wanted to be part of the group?
What did you do?

Two faced bitches never lie
And therefore I never lie
Diagram this sin triangle:
But the biblical kind and not sine

Because I don't know what to say
And a sickness by another name
Wouldn't be sweet either but
With luck, it would at least, like, not suck

And some bitches never lie
Therefore i never lie
Diagram this sin triangle:
For me tonight 
Because I don't know what to say

A sickness by another name
Wouldn't be sweet either but
With luck, it would at least look much more tame
