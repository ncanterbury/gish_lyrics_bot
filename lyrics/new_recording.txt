Welcome to the eleventh hour
So what in the world have you done?
You can’t just daydream a tower
Build a hut just for fun, then start over one by one

Before the clock strikes zero one two 
will you finally get it through-
There is a lot that you forgot to do

What are you doing new years
What are you doing new years
What are you doing new year’s eve?

I wrote this riff last december
And i played it all year 
to make sure that i remember

It didn’t make any sense then
And it still doesn’t, 
but to be fair nether does anything

Before the clock strikes zero one two 
will you finally get it through-
There is a lot that you were able to do

What are you doing new years
What are you doing new years
What are you doing new year’s eve?
