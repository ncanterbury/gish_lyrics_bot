Just to start this off,
This isn’t the start of anything,
Just a song that I can sing to you

We’re standing in a graveyard,
A presumably dead arm
Popped through the grass,
And who doesn’t talk about that?

Honey, you are nothing to me
Alcohol and dopamine
I'm dying on the sofa
And I barely know the time

Like an old man, say I reckon,
I love you for a millisecond,
But I don’t wear a watch or Rolex
And my brain’s a toddler rollerskating down a hill,

I took a spill
And ran into a tree,
And suffered minor injuries

Honey, you are nothing to me,
I don’t call people anything 
that’s thought to be so sweet

But I'm just being bitchy,
Cause every stupid boy skipped over me

On our twilight hour meet and greet,
A coffee table theater scene,
Disregard the soaring chick back there in corner three,
I'd rather let the poor kid sleep

But he’s tripping balls
he’s tripping testes,
LSD, post-wisdom teeth,
He got lost in the shower and he barely knows the hour

I wanna know your passwords
Without changing them in Preferences
And all the childhood streets and deceased pets that they're referencing

And in the box I'll type,
I’ll know all the numbers to try,
I wanna know the lyrics 
that you think of when you’re high

Cause I'm in love 
with strangers who I’ve never even seen,
In love with weird cut bangs 
and sweaters swaying kind of awkwardly

I’m in love with fresh air friends 
from overheated houses
till I Uber up a giant park 
and dump my body in my dorm bed

Honey, you are nothing to me
I don’t call people anything 
that’s thought to be so sweet
The speech is coming back 
with a vengeance it seems

And all these pretend spouses 
are a happy storybook

That’ll turn to stark nonfiction 
in the time it took
For me to notice that I’m old
which means I’ll be 30 and happy,
Likely married to personified business casual khakis

And I’ll forget about it 
when I wake up late and stupid
I tried to tell the Uber driver 
till he tried to hit it

I tried to tell myself because I've come this far along
Carrying my zombie arm to the 14th grade prom

Honey, you are nothing to me
I don’t call people anything 
that's thought to be so sweet
The speech is coming back with a vengeance it seems
