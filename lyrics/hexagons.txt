I want to learn math again
Just to feel better than
My socially adjusted friends
And get a 95 percent

Tiny plastic polygons
I'm building things that aren't real -
Endless streams of hexagons
And other fun materials

I play Jumpstart, but math's hard
And I can't stand learning anything

I like when people think I'm smart
But I'm dumb, so I won't add sums up anymore

And I barely even care 
that I'm forgetting all the Common Core
I won't add sums up anymore
I won't add sums up anymore

Turns out I want this class to end
I don't need to learn to hate it again

I'm falling out of my seat
And drawing on the worksheets -
Exactly how I used to be

And it's a blast to high-achieve,
But only cause approval is the root of what I need,

I guess I'll study something else
But this time I won't hate myself

I play Jumpstart, but math's hard
And I can't stand learning anything

I like when grown-ups call me smart
But I'm dumb, so I won't add sums up anymore

And I barely even care 
that I'm forgetting all the Common Core
I won't add sums up anymore
I won't add sums up anymore

"Squares are fake, like the moon landing."
"Uh, that's false, I think you should, uh, just go home."
"Okay."
"The door's there."

I play Jumpstart, but math's hard
And I can't stand learning anything

I like when people think I'm smart
But I'm dumb, so I won't add sums up anymore
