Some say culture is dead,
But when they do, someone shakes his head,

Like, maybe true, but my name is Ed,
And I’ll buy a house or two or three,
Or four and hoard them in my inventory

Down the turnpike,
Cardboard signs

And I’m killing the game now, honey,
Don’t you doubt it

Ed balls hard 'cause Ed buys houses,
Maison money, Ed’s about it,
Ed balls hard 'cause Ed buys houses

He’s not a myth or somebody made up in stories,
If you don’t have a house to take,
Get the hell out the garden state

I’m killing the game now, honey,
Don’t you doubt it

Ed balls hard 'cause Ed buys houses,
Maison money, Ed’s about it,
Ed balls hard 'cause Ed goes far

In the game now, honey,
Don’t you doubt it
