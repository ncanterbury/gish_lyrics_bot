JK I’m not depressed I’d rather sleep in
All day till I’m dead

And all the arachnids I’m supposed to eat by accident
Miraculously exit,
Crawl out my underbite
And I wake up at midnight
Eight legs and tiny eyes

No time for factoids
Lets get to work, boys!
No task at all we’ll all just bounce right off the walls

Do you know what I'm about to say
I think she shoved all summer in a day
I don’t try and I don’t mind
Because I know it’s just a brilliant time

Now that’s done,
Party of one
I swear that I’ll be buckets of fun
I swear I won’t resume being a square 
until the partying is done

When I’m going to bed I’d rather sleep in,
Not like it’s different,
It’s probably morning and if I was counting sheep 
they’d all be flaming and unhappy

I’ll spend my life at home
A housewife but alone
Tea at the tree dome

No time for factoids
Lets get to work, boys!
No tasks at all let’s all just bounce right off the walls

Do you know what I'm about to say
I think she shoved all summer in a day
I don’t try and I don’t mind
Because I know it’s just a brilliant time

Now that’s done,
Party of one
I swear that I’ll be buckets of fun
Swear I won’t resume being a square until the partying is done
