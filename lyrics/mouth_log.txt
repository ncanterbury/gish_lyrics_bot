On my phone, I’ve got a list
Of food i ate and people I kissed
Because of this I'm losing weight
And batting my eyes like siren bait

Just like a hate-watched series
I catalog life dearly
Dreary how-tos on half-assed self abuse

Probably when i'm 22
Then I'll be doing something new
Because I lose attention fast
And I get bored right off the bat

But I hate class, and I hate work
And doing nothing's even worse
But I still curse and complain every day

If I thrive best in hate machines
And shallow tabloid magazines
And groups for memes, where everyone fights
And tries to make straight white boys cry

Then will I die still swallowing
All sides of conflict, possibly
I’m 3 percent non-hikikomori

97 speaks and now I'm there
Fuzzy socks and shampooed hair

Cyst acne bare, I’m eating healthy
Watching Ina cook for Jeffery

I'm kinda pissed if this is the real me
At least I know who I kissed and what I eat
