Caught me shoegazing like some lo-fi band,
A desperate beer in each one of my hands,
I’ll dance the night away to prove it’s great.

Ten minutes later, repetitive lines,
Valencia filters are passing the time, and
the photo’s flash has made my eyes
Appear to be the ghostly kind

but I’ve sunk into music just like the dead sea
I try and go further til buoyancy floats me,
semi sobriety,
an unconscious mess I guess I’ll never be

that’s fine, I’ll pop sugar pills all night
all night, all night 
i’ll pop sugar pills all night

I can’t see a thing in the haze around me
I’m still having fun cause I know I should be
when will I stop being such a dumb kid and go
wherever real life is?

But why would I lie when I said I won’t?
I know that I am damned if I do or if I don’t.

that’s fine, as I’ll pop sugar pills all night,
all right, all right,
placebo-ing on friday night

I’m just a weed growing out of the wall -
it’s an obvious secret that’s kept by us all tonight
but this will die with me,

I’ll bury it deep in my broken phone screen
alright, till the backlight kills my sight

But tell me that funny things don’t go away
and promise we’ll keep being stupid all day

so hey, who needs life anyway?
let’s stay immature and let's not ever stray

all right, let’s pop sugar pills all night
all right, all right, let’s pop sugar pills all night

I can’t see a thing in the haze around me
I’m still having fun cause I know I should be
when will I stop being such a dumb kid and go
wherever real life is?

But why would I lie when I said I won’t?
I know that I am damned if I do or if I don’t.
That’s fine, as I’ll pop sugar pills all night,
