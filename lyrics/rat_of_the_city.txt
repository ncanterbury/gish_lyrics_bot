I would let solipsists
Plug me in the matrix
Rest in it, happy to think
Not cut out for anything

So your taste is the best like the books that you read
But i’m not a lot like you
When we act really blank and stand in the same places
The standing’s all we do

And i don’t mean to say there’s a vat for my brain
But i’m not a lot like you
If i’m floating alone, then the liquid’s my home
And at least i’ve got the goo

Leaving, straight back to the wall
Thinking, filtering it all
Just observe don’t say a word
Ghost town no dogs allowed

Upon realizing i don’t owe you a thing
There’s a lazy sense of glee
Down the corners and streets i’m a rat of the city
I’m not a lot like me

Rebrand as NPC, audience on TV
My own latchkey kid i’ll be
If i’m floating alone, then the liquid’s my home
And at least i’ve got saline
