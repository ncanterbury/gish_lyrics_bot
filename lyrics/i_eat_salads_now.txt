It pains me to say but
Maybe i’ll grown out of it 
I’m a businessman
I don’t waste time on any shit 

These sweet instincts
Ruin my life
There’s no progress
Just good times

Bitch I’m wasted
Just kidding I’m high
We’re gonna go to a show
And then come home and then probably die

These sweet instincts
Ruin my life
There’s no progress
Just good times

Bitch I’m wasted
Just kidding I’m high
We’re gonna go to a show
And then come home and then probably die

It pains me to say but
Maybe i’ve grown out of it 
I’m 20
Washed up already
All I want to do is sit 

These sweet instincts 
Ruin my life 
There’s no progress 
Just good times 

Bitch I’m wasted 
Just kidding I’m high
We’re gonna go to a show
And then come home and then probably die

These sweet instincts 
Ruin my life 
There’s no progress 
Just good times 

Bitch i’m wasted 
Just kidding i’m high
We’re gonna go to a show
And then come home and then probably die
