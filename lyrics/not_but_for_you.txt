You don’t come around here like you’re supposed to do
I'm sitting around here waiting next to you
I see the truth
Is right inside of you

Who could take a minute just to talk to you
And walk away with everybody who
Could leave you too
I’m right in front of you

Oooooooo
Glitter candy and perfume
Ooooooo
Bubble bath of entropy

La la la la la
And what a lovely day
La la la la la
And what a lovely feeling

We - we met inside the gelateria
You worked the motherfucking register
Reminded me it was a pizzeria

I - i looked around at all the pies
I cleared my throat and said “oh no. you’re right.”
And then i tried to bleach my whole damn mind that night

You don’t come around here like you’re supposed to do
I'm sitting round here waiting next to you
I see the truth
Is right inside of you

Glitter candy and perfume
Bubble bath of entropy
And what a lovely day
And what a lovely feeling

Careers are on the phone 
but i don’t care about it, 
but i don’t care about it bunny
