At least I can advance
Through peacetime in a trance
Bad days too I’ve no restrictions on the mood
Just the degree of effort -

Usage of the brain
Process phantom pain
Eye strain too, the strength of which should be profuse
And add to the collective hurt

So what practical matters must I settle first
What practical matters must be put down, which ones to
Shoot with tranquilizers, leave them falling on the ground
And made into a bearskin rug

But get this, the bearskin is a list
And I’m too distracted to go explaining this
So I’ll just canon stamp it

I want to see you at night
Another day, another time
I can’t stand in this lit hallway anymore
I want to be liked

And despite
A past of bad ideas and advice
I sit still and wonder why I ever tried
To think that you were any different
