Well, I took someone's advice
With a roll of each eye, 
she told me to sit down twice
What do you want from me tonight?

Now I’m stuck losing my mind
While everyone else 
just thinks that I'm really shy
What do you want from me tonight?

Cause I'm invited, but I'm terrifying too
And I'll sit here for a million years 
just staring across the room

But what do you want?
Cause I want it all -
And I'd really rather step back
but my back's against the wall

What if I'm too nice?
It’s a punch in the face to be so over polite
What do you want from me tonight?

And my voice is too high,
And it matches my head 
and I look like I wanna die,
What do you want from me tonight?

Cause I'm invited, but I'm terrifying too
And I'll sit here for a million years 
just staring across the room

But what do you want?
Cause I want it all -
And I'd really rather step back
but my back's against the wall

And I'm born too tall 
to contort my spine into a ball
And I wanna disappear 
but I’m not adequately small

I'm invited but I'm terrifying too
And I'll sit here for a million years 
just staring across the room

But what do you want?
Cause I want it all -
And I'd really rather step back
but my back's against the wall
