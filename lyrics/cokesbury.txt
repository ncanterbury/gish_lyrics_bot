Cokesbury calamine
A road I made up in my mind
It took some time but now
I know I won't throw up and I'll just drive

Cokesbury, Califon
I'm being strung along
By nineteen little threads
Tightly wrapped around my head

Don't worry about me
I'm finishing things off swimmingly
Don't worry about me
I'm getting lost in Cokesbury

Cokesbury calamine
I now apologize
For never doing anything
And dying in the countryside

Cokesbury now I'm done
I'm dancing in the sun
And bopping to the moon
thereâ€™s better barn towns coming soon

Don't worry about me
I'm finishing things off swimmingly
Don't worry about me
I'm getting lost in Cokesbury

Cokesbury calamine,
I hate this little state but I'll hang out for one more night
I send my best regards with my goodbye

Cokesbury calamine
Man, after all this time
Of reigning in my basement
I thought that I'd feel different

Don't worry about me
I'm finishing things off swimmingly
Don't worry about me
I'm getting lost in Cokesbury
