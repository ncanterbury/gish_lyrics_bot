Sixty-five miles an hour
I'm not home yet
Telephone poles get
Blurred together, in gray weather
Till they look like crucifixes

Until something in me thinks if
I was nimble enough,
I’d climb one up and be a symbol
Giving cars a heart attack

Cause I’ve got a knack for these shock tactics
And I want my suburb back.

But it was never mine,
Besides, I’d never crucify
Myself, and Jesus of suburbia’s
A myth that never died

Homecoming queen, not in my dreams
I'll be homecoming serf, it seems
But hey, it doesn’t even bother me
We’ve moved away, and who needs royalty?

I love vacation days
It’s a blacked out haze I’m in
This cul-de-sac is coming
Back, back back back back

Who cares if we're obscure
Homecoming serf
I know this quiet life, it used to hurt
But now we're dancing round and laughing in the dirt

It's barely one PM
And my cooking's barely done
And my thighs feel like the chicken breast I hated slicing up

I think I'll be a vegetarian, kill two birds with one stone
I’ll lose a stone, I'll feel humane
I cook the meat and eat it anyway

I think that I’ll rebel now
Not like my age is too late
I'm still half straight but I can easily
Act gayer than FCK H8

And I'll tell kids to smoke cigs and weed
Despite the surgeon’s warning
I’ll eat LSD soaked mini wheats
In White Russians for breakfast every morning

I love vacation days
It’s a blacked out haze I’m in
This cul-de-sac is coming
Back, back back back back

Who cares if we're obscure
Homecoming serf
I know this quiet life, it used to hurt
But now we're dancing round and laughing in the dirt

Don’t think I'm pointing fingers
These are crocodile tears
It's no one's fault but mine
That I shut up
For all of eighteen years

But now my friends are driving out
We’re gonna walk around the mall
We'll be the youngest there
Who cares, we'll call ourselves adults

At least I've got a cat,
Though she hates me bad, it seems

But we reign over the SUVs and Dairy Queens
This isn't lyricism
I'm just dropping rhymes like flies

Let’s go freak out everyone
No reason, who knows why?

What’s on your mind?
Not like I've got the time to stick around,
I’ll catch my flight,
Make like a pop punk kid, and get out of this town

What’s on your mind?
There’s no point left to keep your image down,
Let’s terrify

I love vacation days
It’s a blacked out haze I'm in
This cul-de-sac is coming
Back, back back back back

Who cares if we're obscure
Homecoming serf
I know this quiet life, it used to hurt
But now we're dancing round and laughing in the dirt

This one goes out to my homecoming serfs
Yeah, pour one out for my homecoming serfs
This one goes out to my homecoming serfs
We’re dancing round and laughing in the dirt
